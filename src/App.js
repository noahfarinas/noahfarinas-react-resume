    "	I value being a self-starter to achieve the goals I have set for myself.  Having gotten accepted into the Computer Science program at Seattle Pacific University, I became more interested in Front-end development.  To immerse myself further, I began exploring alternative ways of learning Front-end development through Udemy, Google, Youtube, and creating projects on Github pages.  Through my own curiosity Iâ€™ve found Front-end development to be an exciting and challenging field to pursue."
